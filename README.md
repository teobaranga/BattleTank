# BattleTank

![](Screenshots/screenshot.png)

An open world head-to-head tank fight game with simple AI, terrain, and advanced control system in Unreal Engine 4.

This is my personal implementation of the project with the same name from "The Unreal Engine Developer Course" on Udemy.

**Last completed lecture:** Using `LineTraceSingleByChannel()` (31/113)

### Features:
- Basic textured landscape sculpted using Unreal
- High quality tank model ([T90 by milosbaskic](https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/military/vehicle/russian-military-vehicles-t90))
- Basic UI with crosshairs
- Functionality that allows detecting the world location of the point aimed at by the crosshairs
