# BattleTank

![](Screenshots/screenshot.png)

An open world head-to-head tank fight game with simple AI, terrain, and advanced control system in Unreal Engine 4.

This is my personal implementation of the project with the same name from "The Unreal Engine Developer Course" on Udemy.

**Last completed lecture:** Turret Rotation Pt.2 (45/113)

### Features:
- Basic textured landscape sculpted using Unreal
- High quality tank model ([T90 by milosbaskic](https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/military/vehicle/russian-military-vehicles-t90))
- Basic UI with crosshairs
- Aiming functionality: the turret rotates and the barrel raises or lowers in such a way that a projectile shot with a specified speed could land at the world location pointed at by the crosshairs
